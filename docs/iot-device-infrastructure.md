# IoT Device Infrastructure

The IoT infrastructure creates device resources from `config_iot_devices.json`. All devices in a twin use one shared IoT policy named `<digitalTwinName>-iot-policy`. Each device has its own Thing, certificate, and authentication files.

The deployment is organized into three specific layers, executed in the order of **L1 → L2 → L4** (and destroyed in the strict reverse order of **L4 → L2 → L1**). Notably, there is no IoT L3 layer because storage is handled by the shared Core L3 infrastructure.

## Deployment Layers Breakdown

### IoT L1: Device Identity and Connectivity

- Creates the AWS IoT Thing, which represents the device in AWS IoT Core.
- Generates a certificate, public key, and private key to allow the device to authenticate and publish MQTT messages.
- Stores authentication files locally in an `iot_devices_auth/` directory.
- Creates or reuses the shared IoT policy before creating device identities.
- Attaches the shared policy to each device certificate.

`IotPolicyDeployer` manages the shared policy. `IotThingDeployer` manages Things,
certificates, and their attachments. Removing one device preserves the shared
policy. The policy remains when the device list is empty. Destroying the twin
removes it after all device identities. A policy with remaining targets is not
deleted.

When `deploy` or a saved `apply` is repeated, IoT L1 reads the current Thing
principals before creating a certificate. If one principal is attached, it
reuses that certificate and completes the shared-policy attachment. It keeps
the local certificate and key files. If multiple principals are attached,
deployment stops before creating another certificate.

For an existing deployment, run `plan`, then `apply`. IoT L1 uses `UPDATE` to
attach the shared policy before detaching each legacy `<digitalTwinName>-<iotDeviceId>`
policy. This preserves Things, certificates, and local authentication files.
Unused legacy policies and their non-default versions are then removed.
Policies still attached to other targets are retained. Unrelated policies are
not removed during migration. The shared policy retains the existing permission
document (`iot:*` on `*`).

After migration, a device has `NO_CHANGE` when all its principals use the shared
policy and none uses its legacy policy. A legacy policy retained for another
target does not trigger another device update. If that policy later has no
targets, `plan` schedules an `UPDATE` to remove it. Planning reads all target
pages needed for this check. AWS errors other than a missing policy stop planning.

Migration needs one free policy slot and permission to call `iot:GetPolicy` and
`iot:ListTargetsForPolicy`, in addition to the existing IoT permissions.
AWS can delay policy deletion for up to five minutes after detachment; see
[DeletePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_DeletePolicy.html).
If cleanup reports a conflict, run a new `plan` and `apply` after that delay.
Device removal keeps its action pending if policy deletion reports a conflict;
repeat `apply` after the delay.
If a full destroy reports a conflict, repeat `destroy` after the delay.

### IoT L2: Device-Specific Processing

- Creates a unique Processor Lambda and IAM Role for each configured device.
- Unlike the shared Dispatcher Lambda (which only routes messages), the Processor Lambda handles device-specific tasks like normalizing payloads, converting units, and validating values.
- The deployer uses custom code for the processor if it exists, or automatically falls back to a default generic processor.
- After processing, this Lambda passes the data to the shared Persister Lambda.

### IoT L4: TwinMaker Component Types

- Creates an AWS IoT TwinMaker Component Type for each device.
- Defines the data structure, including property names, data types, flags indicating whether the data is time-series and stored externally.
- Sets up data reader functions that point to the shared hot-reader Lambda. Since TwinMaker stores only the digital twin model and not the actual telemetry data, these functions act as a bridge, allowing TwinMaker to dynamically fetch external property values from DynamoDB whenever a user or dashboard requests them.
- This layer only creates the Component Type (the template); attaching these components to the actual digital twin Entities is handled separately by the hierarchy deployer based on `config_hierarchy.json`.
